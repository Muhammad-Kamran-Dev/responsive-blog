            I used to be a pack rat. I had so many things that I thought that I
            loved, but the truth was I couldn't even appreciate any of it
            because there was too much.
          </p>
          <p class="article-body">
            Things were terrible. I had a job that I hated, a home that I didn't
            want to live in, and I couldn't hold a relationship.
          </p>
          <h3>How I turned things around</h3>
          <p class="article-body">
            I was on the verge of a breakdown when I got rid of everything. I
            literally put 90% of my possessions in the garbage, sold my place
            and moved into a smaller apartment, and I quit my job. It wasn't
            easy at all, but everything around me was in such a bad place, I
            didn't know what else to do. And it worked.
          </p>
          <h3>Now I live the simple life</h3>
          <p class="article-body">
            Now that I'm living a simple life, things are so much better. I'm
            less stressed, enjoy life and work more, and I have more free time
            to enjoy.
          </p>
          <p class="article-body">
            With how much it turned my life around, I felt like I had no choice
            but to start sharing how I did it, and how others can benefit from
            living a simple life as well, which is why I started this site!

              Food is a very important part of everyone's life. If you want to
              be healthy, you have to eat healthy. One of the easiest ways to do
              that is to keep your cooking nice and simple.

            <h3>Simplicity and work</h3>
            <p class="article-body">
              Work is often a major source of stress. People get frustrated, it
              ruins their relationship with others and it leads to burnout. By
              keeping your work life as simple as possible, it will help balance
              everything out.

            <p class="article-body">
              A home isn't a home until you've decorated a little. People either
              don't decorate, or they go overboard and it doesn't have the
              impact they were hoping for. Staying simple will help draw the eye
              where you want it to and make things pop like never before.
